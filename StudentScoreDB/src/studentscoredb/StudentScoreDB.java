// update records in the database, and show them on the screen. Do the task below:

// o Your program, when it begins, will create the database/table and records in MySQL.
//   Name your database as student_management and name your table as
//    student_score.
//   If a database with the same name already exists in MySQL, it must be deleted before
//    database creation.
//   Add a few records in the table, e.g. English:95, Math:98, Science:89
//   Provide your sql of database/table creation in a text file. Name this file as
//    student_management.sql.
// o Demonstrate reading the records from the table and show them on the screen.
// o Demonstrate updating the records of the table and show them on the screen.
// o Use the commit() method for database transaction integrity.
// o Save your main class file as StudentScoreDB.java.
